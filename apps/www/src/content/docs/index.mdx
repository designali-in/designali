**Designali offers a set of beautifully crafted, accessible components and a flexible code distribution platform. It works seamlessly with your favorite frameworks and AI tools — Open Source. Open Code.
## Why Designali?

- **Open Code:** Full access to component code, ready for modification.
- **Composition:** Consistent, flexible interfaces for predictable usage.
- **Distribution:** Share and install components through a simple schema and CLI.
- **Beautiful Defaults:** Beautifully designed out-of-the-box components.
- **AI-Ready:** Open code makes it easy for AI models to understand and enhance.

## Open Code

With Designali, you don’t just consume components — you own them. Each piece of code is yours to modify, extend, and perfect:

- **Full Transparency:** Understand how every component works under the hood.
- **Easy Customization:** Adapt behavior, styles, and functionality with ease.
- **AI Integration:** Open access lets AI models help refine and improve your design.

_Instead of wrapping and overriding pre-built components, just edit them directly — simple and efficient._
 
## Composition

Every component in shadcn/ui shares a common, composable interface. **If a component does not exist, we bring it in, make it composable, and adjust its style to match and work with the rest of the design system.**

_A shared, composable interface means it's predictable for both your team and LLMs. You are not learning different APIs for every new component. Even for third-party ones._

## Distribution

shadcn/ui is also a code distribution system. It defines a schema for components and a CLI to distribute them.

- **Schema:** A flat-file structure that defines the components, their dependencies, and properties.
- **CLI:** A command-line tool to distribute and install components across projects with cross-framework support.

_You can use the schema to distribute your components to other projects or have AI generate completely new components based on existing schema._

## Beautiful Defaults

shadcn/ui comes with a large collection of components that have carefully chosen default styles. They are designed to look good on their own and to work well together as a consistent system:

- **Good Out-of-the-Box:** Your UI has a clean and minimal look without extra work.
- **Unified Design:** Components naturally fit with one another. Each component is built to match the others, keeping your UI consistent.
- **Easily Customizable:** If you want to change something, it's simple to override and extend the defaults.

## AI-Ready

The design of shadcn/ui makes it easy for AI tools to work with your code. Its open code and consistent API allow AI models to read, understand, and even generate new components.

_An AI model can learn how your components work and suggest improvements or even create new components that integrate with your existing design._
